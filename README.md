# Simple Library Project

## Project Overview 
- In this project, I am expected to create a simple library web application, with books' information in it. 

## Basic Features of the App
- A library that contains different books' information.
- Each of the book should have a unique ID, needed to specifically identify them.
- The Information of each book will include: Author, Number of pages, Title, and if it has been read or not.

## Tools
- HTML.
- CSS.
- Javascript.
